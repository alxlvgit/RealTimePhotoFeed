# Real-time photo feed
This app allows the user to upload an image and feed it to all page viewers in real-time.\
In this app, I used:
- The Node HTTP module to create the server and handle the routes.
- The Formidable npm package to implement the image upload functionality.
- The Socket.IO library for real-time photo updates on the page.
